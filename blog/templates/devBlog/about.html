                <p>
                    My name is Dominykas Gudauskas. I come from a small country in the North-East of Europe
                    called Lithuania. Currently studying Computer Science at the University of
                    Birmingham and doing pretty well for myself. I've interned at Barclays as a
                    Technology Developer and even though it's my only real developer work experience, I've been
                    working on a couple personal projects in my free time. As well as coding I really enjoy
                    taking photos of things and places around me and you may see one or two of my pictures on
                    the site. I will most likely be updating this blog as I progress through my career and life
                    in general and hopefully this will turn into a one-stop site for friends and employers.

            <h5 class="mt-5">About The Blog</h5>
            <p>
                I started the blog as a task for my university, but in the future when I dabble a bit more in
                web development I might experiment with the website and turn it into a completely different
                project. For now it's just something I can show my friends and colleagues and obviously,
                my university lecturers. Making the blog was a fun challenge; I got to work with Python and
                Django, something I feel I should've done ages ago, but I'm happy I got around to doing it
                eventually. I used an HTML template for the design of the blog for now, but I might dabble
                with HTML and CSS to make something of my own whenever I get around to actually sitting down
                and just writing it up. First basic posts are there, all that's left now is to just add more
                and more on top!
